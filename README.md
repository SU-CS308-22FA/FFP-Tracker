### Description

FFP Tracker is a web application to further transparency about the revenues and expenses of the teams that are a part of the Turkish Football Federation by making teams submit their financial documents to the system. After submissions, the federation and its lawyers will have a chance to review the files, approve or deny them based on their conclusions. With that in mind, teams will need to work harder to generate more streams of revenue to stay within their budget limits, and spend at most as much as they earn. Some actions can be taken before a serious breach of regulations as the system will be able to forecast the teams’ future situations. All information will be publicly available to all, in line with the aim to increase transparency.

### Deployment

#### Heroku Deployment

To deploy your application to Heroku, you can follow these steps:

1. Open an Heroku account
2. Create a new application on Heroku
3. Subscribe to the Heroku Student Developer to receive credits or pay to get credits
4. Enable GitHub Integration
5. Select GitHub deploy
6. Select automatic deploy or manually deploy to the main branch.
7. Once you are done with the development, merge your code to the main branch. This will automatically build and host the new version of your application.
8. To add the environment variables in you .env file, follow these steps:
   - The first step is to log into your account and go to the Heroku dashboard.
   - Choose the application for which you want to set the environment variables. Once you select the application, it takes you to the overview page of that project.
   - The next step is to go to the "Settings" page.
   - Once you are on the "Settings" page, scroll until you see the "Config Vars" section. To add config vars (environment variables) or modify the existing ones, click on "Reveal Config Vars".
     - If you do not have any config vars, you should see a warning message.
   - The last step is to set the config vars. In the KEY field, you specify the name of your environment variable, whereas in the VALUE field, you specify its actual value. An example would be storing the database URL as an environment variable.
   - After entering both the key and the value, press "Add" and you are done.
